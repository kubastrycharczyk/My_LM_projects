**RUN 1.** Scores from cross-validation achieved after first training run.  

| Scoring type | Score |
|------------|------------|
| MAE    | 0.4263353552437346    | 
| MSE     | 0.3087935913713184    | 
| RMSE     | 0.5552154450490114    | 
| R2     | 0.4721765387710703     | 
|Date: |10.09.2025|

**Analysis:** Errors of model are relativly low, that sugests that model well predicts values. Score of R2 seems to be insufficient explaining only 47% of variability.

**Next step:** Hyperparameter tuning.
